## Ruby Dolphins Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Ruby Dolphins project. This project was created by four students who are currently studying Frontend development. It serves as their first project where they have ventured into the realm of Fullstack development. The Ruby Dolphins project is a full-stack web application built using HTML, CSS, React and JavaScript. It aims to provide a platform for retrieving RESTful APIs related to products and users.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Ruby Dolphins frontend, follow the instructions below:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    
    shellCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/MalinJ123/Ruby_Dolphins.git` 
    
2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    
    shellCopy code
    
    `cd Ruby_Dolphins/frontend` 
    
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to access the application.
    

### Features

The Ruby Dolphins frontend offers the following features:

1.  Product Information: Retrieve and display information about various products available through the RESTfull API.
2.  User Details: Fetch and show details of users registered on the platform.
3.  Interactive UI: Enjoy a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and visually appealing design.

### Development

To run the frontend in development mode, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser(recomended google chrome). Any changes you make to the code can be tested and previewed directly in the browser.

### Production Deployment

To deploy the Ruby Dolphins frontend to a production environment, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure that you have set up a web server capable of serving static files.
2.  Copy the contents of the `frontend` directory to your web server's document root or appropriate location.
3.  Configure the web server to serve the `index.html` file as the default entry point for the application.
